- presenter: Melissa Herrera (@MelGoesTech | in:herrera-melissa)
	- melissa.herrera@datastax.com
- what is it?
	- _visual-first_, but not visual-only agent development platform
		- code is fully exposed
		- can build custom components with code
	- python-native
	- includes mcp, agents, RAG
	- does **not** include visibility (but can connect to Langchain for that)
	- Agent component
		- model is configurable, as are agent instructions and tools
	- Multi-agent Orchestration
		- see demo...
- vs. n8n or Langgraph?
	- n8n is more focused at the ops level Langflow is more focused at the agent level
- tools
	- _Composio_... useful tool for doing integrations via a single api key (eg., Google OAuth)
		- in demo, she made `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` out of this tool
- MCP
	- Langflow has an MCP server tool...
		- agents can use MCP to understand other tools
		- Langflow can be used to _export MCP servers_ linking tools and understanding to agents like Claude
	- "both an MCP builder and an MCP aggregator"
- deployed with Render, Docker, etc.
	- check their videos
- a2a protocol: allow agents to change each other's prompts?
	- not something Langflow supports yet
