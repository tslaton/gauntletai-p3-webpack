# File Wrangler Enhanced Organization Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced File Wrangler functionality that automatically organizes PDFs into categorized subfolders using AI-powered metadata extraction and intelligent file organization.

## Key Changes

### 1. File Structure Changes
- **Old behavior**: Files were renamed in-place within the watched directory
- **New behavior**: Files are moved to `file wrangler/inbox/` after processing, then organized into categorized subfolders

### 2. Enhanced Metadata Extraction
The PDF processing pipeline now extracts additional metadata:
- **Tags**: 3-5 descriptive tags capturing document nature and content
- **Category Hint**: Suggested category folder (e.g., "financial", "medical", "insurance")
- **Document Type**: Specific classification (e.g., "bank-statement", "invoice", "policy")

### 3. Organization Pipeline
A new LangGraph-based organization pipeline (`organizationPipeline.ts`) that:
1. **Scans** the inbox for unorganized PDF files
2. **Plans** an intelligent folder structure using LLM analysis
3. **Executes** file movements to appropriate subfolders

### 4. Auto-Organization with Debouncing
- Automatically triggers when inbox reaches threshold (default: 10 files)
- Uses debouncing to handle batch file drops efficiently
- Waits 5 seconds after last file processed before organizing
- Can be enabled/disabled via settings

### 5. Configuration Options
New settings added to electron-store:
- `autoOrganize`: Enable/disable automatic organization (default: true)
- `autoOrganizeThreshold`: Number of files to trigger auto-organization (default: 10)

## Architecture

### File Flow
1. PDF detected in watch folder
2. Text extracted (with OCR fallback)
3. LLM extracts metadata including tags and categories
4. File renamed and moved to `file wrangler/inbox/`
5. Metadata saved to `.metadata.json`
6. Auto-organization triggered after debounce period
7. Organization agent analyzes all inbox files
8. Files moved to appropriate category subfolders

### Folder Structure Example
```
watch-folder/
├── file wrangler/
│   ├── inbox/              # Newly processed files
│   ├── financial/          # Bank statements, tax documents
│   ├── medical/            # Medical records, prescriptions
│   ├── insurance/          # Insurance policies, claims
│   ├── property/           # Real estate documents
│   ├── services/           # Utility bills, service contracts
│   ├── receipts/           # Purchase receipts, invoices
│   └── .metadata.json      # File metadata storage
```

## API Changes

### New IPC Handlers
- `organize-files`: Manually trigger file organization
- `get-inbox-count`: Get number of files in inbox
- `organization-status`: Event emitted during organization process

### Updated Configuration
```typescript
{
  watchFolder: string,
  openaiApiKey: string,
  llmModel: string,
  useLowercase: boolean,
  processingMode: 'accuracy' | 'speed',
  autoOrganize: boolean,        // NEW
  autoOrganizeThreshold: number  // NEW
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Debouncing Strategy
The auto-organization uses a smart debouncing mechanism:
- Timer starts when a file is processed
- Timer resets if another file is processed within 5 seconds
- Ensures batch drops are fully processed before organizing

### Metadata Persistence
File metadata is stored in `.metadata.json` including:
- Original file path
- Processing timestamp
- Extracted metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
- Current file location

### Error Handling
- Failed file moves are logged but don't stop the process
- Partial organization is supported (some files may fail to move)
- UI receives status updates throughout the process

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single File Processing**: Drop one PDF and verify it moves to inbox
2. **Batch Processing**: Drop 10+ PDFs and verify debouncing works
3. **Auto-Organization**: Verify triggers at threshold
4. **Manual Organization**: Test manual trigger via UI
5. **Category Creation**: Verify appropriate folders are created
6. **Error Scenarios**: Test with locked files, permissions issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Learning System**: Track user corrections to improve categorization
2. **Custom Categories**: Allow users to define their own categories
3. **Bulk Operations**: UI for moving files between categories
4. **Search Integration**: Search across organized files by metadata
5. **Export Options**: Export organized file list with metadata
