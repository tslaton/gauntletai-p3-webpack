First, study the code, including @package.json and @src/ to understand how it works. In short, we are working with an Electron app called File Wrangler that watches a particular configurable directory for pdf files and then renames them according to their contents using, text extraction, OCR, and LLMs. We are using Langgraph to setup the workflow. If you need to review a library's documentation, use context7 (MCP) first, but dig into the node_models, etc. using approach tools if necessary.

Once you understand the code provide me with your approach (or several approaches) to improving the functionality of File Wrangler: we would like to change the behavior so that files renamed by File Wrangler are moved to a `file wrangler` directory inside of the watched directory. Instead of keeping track of files' new names and ignoring those for subsequent processing, we should instead not process anything inside of `file wrangler`. We also want to organize the files so that they are not just loose in the single `file wrangler` directory but rather neatly categorized by subfolders. Examples would be "services", "financial statements", "medical records", "property documents", etc. Probably we will want an LLM agent prompted specifically for this task to decide the appropriate folders, based on the contents it sees. We will need some way to use the understanding an LLM can gain by reading the parsed/OCR'ed contents of each file. My first idea would be to add to the current pipeline state a "tagsByFilename" field that stores an array of tags mapped by each renamed file's name. We could instruct the current LLM to additionally emit a small number of descriptive tags here. Then, I would propose a second agent with its own prompt be charged with the following: 1. read all of the tags and filenames in the `file wrangler` directory that are not already in subfolders 2. devise a subfolder structure (shallow preferred) that organizes the files taking into account their tags and filenames, with the goal of presenting an inuitive final subfolder layout that an average person would be able to use to retrieve the document they are looking for. Produce an array of JSON objects like { "currentPath": <string>, "newPath": <string> } based this subfolder layout. Then given that output, we could finally move the files. 

Please discuss your implementation strategy, whether you take my suggestions or not, before implementing anything.
